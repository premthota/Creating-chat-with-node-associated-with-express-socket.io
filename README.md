# Creating-chat-with-node-associated-with-express-socket.io
This a dynamic web application for chat application using node and with the help of express and socket.io


This is a dynamic web application using node and js.
I will use express to deploy the application or run in the server.
Using npm, i installed body-parser for parsing the middleware with the method json()
It also parses the middleware on the url request using the method urlencoded()
For complete bodyparser documentation you can check the following link
https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser

Socket.io is used by installing internally with npm

Socket.io helps in handling the requests automatically (express has to check the server for every time to check and handle the request)
It is less efficient 
Above package makes it easier for handling the requests like db requests
